## Validate NFT ownership in real life

![theProven](theproven_github.jpg)

How can NFT holders prove they hold an NFT in real life? Is it possible to do this without carrying valuable NFTs in a hot wallet? No one wants to get robbed.

TheProven is a proof of concept to solve these problems. Using a set of tools to prove ownership of NFTs in real life, thProven is composed of a set of smart contracts, a client dApp for holders, and a client dApp for validators.

NFT holders can register their NFTs on chain, then move their valuable NFts to safe storage off chain. The record of their ownership is kept in TheProven smart contract.

NFT verifiers, or those looking to verify holders, scan the QR code of individual registrations to prove ownership. Holders are also required to sign a message from their wallet to complete verification.

This is a work in progress...
